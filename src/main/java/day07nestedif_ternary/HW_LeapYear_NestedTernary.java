        Write a Java program to determine if a given year is a leap year or not.
        A year is a leap year if:
            It is divisible by 4.
            It is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400.

            NOTE: Use NESTED TERNARY

Example:
Year 2000: Divisible by 4, 100, and 400 → Leap Year.
Year 1900: Divisible by 4 and 100, but not by 400 → Not a Leap Year.
Year 2024: Divisible by 4 and not by 100 → Leap Year.
